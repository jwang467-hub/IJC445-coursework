## IJC445 Coursework – Billboard Lyrics Visualisation (2000–2023)

This project explores how the structure and sentiment of Billboard Hot 100 song lyrics changed from 2000 to 2023.  
It focuses on three questions: whether lyrics have become shorter over time, whether sentiment distributions differ by decade, and whether lyrics length is related to sentiment.  
A composite visualisation (four charts: a time trend line, a decade-based boxplot, a scatter plot with LOESS smoothing, and a PCA plot) is used to summarise both univariate trends and multivariate patterns.  
All R code used to clean the lyrics data, compute textual features, and generate the visualisations is included in this repository.
